# Cross-machine session board — bugarach

**In git, therefore it reaches every session on every machine.** This is the half of the
session board that has to travel. The protocol is
[`docs/session_protocol.md`](session_protocol.md) (vendored from interface2); this file is
its Tier-2 ledger.

Companion, **outside git**: `../bugarach-worktrees/SESSIONS.md` — only what genuinely
cannot travel (live process ids, that box's free disk, local scratch paths).

## Which board does this go on?

One test, and it is **not** "is this about my machine?":

> **Can a session on another machine see, reach, or damage the thing you are claiming?**
> **Yes → here, in git. No → the machine-local board.**

The trap is shared storage. A Dropbox or network mount is visible from *every* machine, so a
claim on it is cross-machine even though it feels local.

| goes HERE (git) | stays MACHINE-LOCAL |
|---|---|
| claims on `BUGARACH_DATA_ROOT` stores, the Dropbox darkroom, any `interface2` checkout | live process ids, `pytest -n` jobs |
| exclusive-write claims of any kind | that box's free disk, local scratch |
| "I am regenerating the MATLAB parity fixtures" (needs MATLAB + interface2) | which MATLAB release is installed where |
| messages to another session | — |

**bugarach-specific shared resources worth claiming before writing:**

- `tests/fixtures/ref_*.json` — regenerating these needs MATLAB + an interface2 checkout;
  two sessions regenerating at once will produce conflicting oracles.
- the Dropbox **darkroom** (`<dropbox>/darkroom/constellation/`) — shared across every
  machine and every project that mounts it. Claim before writing.
- any `interface2` worktree you `addpath` — another session may be mid-edit on that branch.

## Protocol for a block

- **Add a block at startup** — address (`<machine>/<branch>`), task, which external paths you
  will write, status.
- **Mark it DONE on exit**, and release any exclusive claim explicitly.
- **Scan the board before writing any shared external output.** If an ACTIVE block claims it,
  use a different namespace or wait.

Template:

```
### <machine>/<branch> — <task>
- **Status:** ACTIVE | DONE
- **Started:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Writes:** <external paths, or "repo only">
- **Claims:** <exclusive-write claims, or "none">
- **Notes:** <anything another session must know>
```

## Active

### mac/site-leads-with-the-idea — publish the driving-idea page + its review to the darkroom
- **Status:** DONE
- **Started:** 2026-08-15
- **Writes:** `<darkroom>/bugarach/2026-08-15-driving-idea/` (NEW) — the built landing page
  and its murderboard record, so Tony can open them without navigating `docs/`.
- **Claims:** that one dated subfolder only. Did not touch anything else under
  `<darkroom>/bugarach/`, and did not go near `<darkroom>/constellation/`.
- **Notes:** `$BUGARACH_DARKROOM` is **unset on this Mac**, so `bugarach.paths.darkroom()`
  returns `None` and the path had to be found by hand. Anyone hitting the same thing:
  the fix is to export it in the shell profile, not to hardcode it (SAP004). The folder
  itself is the one created 2026-08-12 by the WSMIP-win session below.

### WSMIP-win/vendor-session-protocol — vendor the session protocol + audit upstream tooling
- **Status:** DONE
- **Started:** 2026-08-12
- **Writes:** repo only
- **Claims:** none
- **Notes:** Installed the vendored session protocol, the SessionStart hook, and this board.
  Read-only survey of `interface2` (`origin/main`, `origin/detector-defaults-optimized`) and
  the Dropbox darkroom — no writes to either. Findings filed in `docs/todo/`.

### WSMIP-win/vendor-session-protocol — create the bugarach darkroom folder
- **Status:** DONE
- **Started:** 2026-08-12
- **Writes:** `<darkroom>/bugarach/` (NEW), `<darkroom>/README.md` (appended one dated
  UPDATE section — that file is the shared convention and asks for notes to be left in it)
- **Claims:** `<darkroom>/bugarach/` — **exclusive-write for bugarach**. No other project
  writes here; nothing branch-routes into it (it is a separate Python repo, like
  `haruspex/` and `no_peak/`).
- **Notes:** Created because bugarach's output is distinct from the `constellation/` team's
  (Tony, 2026-08-12): constellation is the MATLAB **producer**, bugarach is the Python port
  + viewer that consumes the same contract. Did NOT touch `constellation/` or any other
  project folder. Resolve the path via `$BUGARACH_DARKROOM` — never hardcode it (SAP004).
